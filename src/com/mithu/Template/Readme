This pattern is all about creating a template for an algorithm. What’s a template?
As you’ve seen it’s just a method; more specifi cally, it’s a method that defi nes an
algorithm as a set of steps. One or more of these steps is defi ned to be abstract and
implemented by a subclass. This ensures the algorithm’s structure stays unchanged,
while subclasses provide some part of the implementation.
